# Whittier Alliance Anti-Displacement Mapping 

With this project, we aim to apply in-depth research, GIS mapping technology, and direct engagement with neighborhood renters, homeowners, and property owners to better understand the current landscape of Whittier’s NOAH stock and identify individual properties that may be vulnerable to sale. This will provide the fact basis for a strategic effort to connect with community-minded owners on creative approaches to extend affordability and combat displacement, as prioritized in the Whittier Alliance’s 5-year plan.
